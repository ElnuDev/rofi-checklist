# This repository has moved to [git.elnu.com/ElnuDev/rofi-checklist](https://git.elnu.com/ElnuDev/rofi-checklist)

This project is no longer hosted on GitHub, and has moved to [my self-hosted Gogs instance](https://git.elnu.com/).  GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software (FOSS).  I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop my FOSS project.  I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.
